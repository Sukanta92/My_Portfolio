Data Analytics Projects

# Project 1: Aerodynamic design optimization of rear body shapes of a sedan for drag reduction.
* This is a surrogate tool which uses aerodynamic loadcase datasets to perform predictive analytics for product optimization.
* Over 1000 datasets were scraped from server & preprocessed.
* Various machine learning tools applied to perform analysis.
* Acuuracy for all analysis were compared to get the best methodology.

## Background
Aerodynamic drag is the resistance offered by incoming air flow over an object under motion. The basic formula to equate this resistive force is:
