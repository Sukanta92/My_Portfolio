# Project 1: Aerodynamic design optimization of rear body shapes of a sedan for drag reduction.
* This is a surrogate tool which uses aerodynamic loadcase datasets to perform predictive analytics for product optimization.
* Over 1000 datasets were scraped from server & preprocessed.
* Various machine learning tools applied to perform analysis.
* Acuuracy for all analysis were compared to get the best methodology.
