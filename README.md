# Project 1: Aerodynamic design optimization of rear body shapes of a sedan for drag reduction.
* This is a surrogate tool which uses aerodynamic loadcase datasets to perform predictive analytics for product optimization.
* Over 1000 datasets were scraped from server & preprocessed.
* Various machine learning tools applied to perform analysis.
* Acuuracy for all analysis were compared to get the best methodology.

## Background
Aerodynamic drag is the resistance offered by incoming air flow over an object under motion. Formula to equate this resistive force: \

It is evident from above formula that the resistive force increases exponentially with an increase in velocity.
Aerodynamic drag force is one of the major contibutors in motion resistance & a lot of fuel energy is converted to overcome this.
And the the resistive force is directly proportional to the coefficient of drag (Cd) which is a shape function of the object under motion.

A sedan (example: as shown below)is typically known for its stylish design & minimum drag force.
However, the rear end shape of a sendan is crutial for its wake region.
Optimizing the shape may lead to minimizing the coefficient of drag & hence improve fuel efficiency. \

## Problem Statement
To minimize drag, i.e. Cd, 4 paramters are being considered to optimize the sedan's rear body shape as shown below: \
